> Training is performed when propulsion_run_me is run.
> To predict, provide the required inputs in propulsion_run_me itself (For user defined data)
> Two files model.py and neural_model.py are exclusively used, if in case wanted to change or alter the model. 
> All the comments are given in propulsion_run_me to assist the smooth running of the program.
> Requirements:
	-tensorflow
	-scikit learn
	-numpy, pandas
	-matplotlib, seaborn
	
NOTE: The model has been created by me from scratch, hence has certain scopes for tuning and development.
